# City Explorer
## Asynchronous code, and APIs

Today you will be building a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated reqeusts for data from a thrid-party API.

## Resources

[Axios on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios){:target="_blank"}

[Location IQ Geocoding API](https://locationiq.com/docs#search-forward-geocoding){:target="_blank"} - Specifically, the "Search / Forward GeoCoding" and "Static Maps" sections.

## Process

For every lab in this module, you will have a new partner. For this lab, you and your new partner(s) will spend the first 15 minutes planning out an approach to this lab's work on a whiteboard.

1. Draw the web request-response cycle for the current lab tasks (about 15 minutes).
   1. Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
   1. Outline the functions that support this data flow.
   1. Be sure to include these drawings in your README.md.

You will then work independently for the rest of the day, implementing your plan, coding in your own repository, submitting your own pull request.

### Workflow

- We will be using the [Trello](https://trello.com/home){:target="_blank"} project management tool for the duration of this project.
- To maximize your experience with Trello, you should create a free Trello account by clicking on the `Sign Up` button.
- After creating an account, go to the [City Explorer Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Ajj9Cbac/module-2-city-explorer){:target="_blank"}, open the "... Show Menu" link, click the "... More" link, and then click "Copy Board". Before you create it, be sure to "Change" from Private to "Public" (and click "Yes, Make Board Public") so your instructional team can see your work. Now, click "Create" to add a copy to your personal account.
- This Trello board contains all of the features required to complete this lab assignment.
- In the "...Show Menu" sidebar, click the "Search Cards" link and filter by lab to see the assignment for just the current day.
- Review the user stories and analyze the feature requests and requirements in the lab.
- Within each story, note the acceptance criteria ("Given ... When ... Then...") and the checklist of feature tasks. Be careful to execute tasks in order as they are often dependencies of one another.
- Throughout the lab time, check off tasks as you complete them, and move the story cards through the workflow.
